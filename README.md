This repo contains several templates for running rust code on android. Each template is 
on a separate branch. Currently there are templates for:
- An application with rust code using JNI
- An APK with a `main`() function (ran using `app_process`), that contains rust code using JNI
- A rust executable
- A rust shared library that is ran using LD_PRELOAD
